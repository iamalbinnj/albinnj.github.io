* **Deepfake Detection from Video**
    + This project aims to identify deepfake videos by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a
                    GRU model. Deepfakes, which replace a person in a video with someone else's likeness, present
                    serious ethical and security risks. This system uses advanced machine learning techniques to
                    accurately differentiate between real and fake media, helping to address these challenges.
